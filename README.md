# Students-Grades-Prediction
The current education system sets milestones that a student is expected to achieve in order to proceed to the next level without considering other factors that may affect the students’ performance.
Our model incorporates other external factors such as the socio-economic factors which may affect the students’ performance to generate a better performance prediction.
